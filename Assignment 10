1. Explain about Selenium Architecture

1. Selenium Architecture Overview
Selenium architecture follows a client-server model and mainly includes the following components:


2. Components of Selenium Architecture:

a. Selenium Client Library
- These are language-specific bindings (Java, Python, C#, etc.) that help write test scripts.
- Example: You use Java bindings to write code in Eclipse/IntelliJ.

b. JSON Wire Protocol (now W3C Protocol)
- It is the protocol used to transfer data between client libraries and browser drivers.
- It converts your code into HTTP requests that the browser understands.

c. Browser Drivers
- Each browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) has its own driver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
- The driver receives HTTP commands from Selenium and interacts with the browser.

d. Browsers
- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
- The browser performs the actual operations like clicking, typing, etc.



3. Flow of Selenium Automation:

1. You write code in your language (Java/Python).
2. Selenium client library sends requests via JSON protocol.
3. Browser driver receives the request and sends it to the browser.
4. Browser performs action and sends response back via driver.



2. Write a program to open website (https://www.saucedemo.com/) and close the browser after priniting a message like "Site navigation success"

package seleniumpractice;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class Seldayone {

	public static void main(String[] args ) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.saucedemo.com");
		
		System.out.println("Site Navigation Success");
	
driver.close();

	}

}

Output:
Site Navigation Success
